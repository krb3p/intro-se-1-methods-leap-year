# Code your methods here!

# 1. Write a method that checks to see if a given year is a leap year, and returns either the boolean value true or false.
def is_leap_year?(year)

end


# 2. Write a method that takes in the current year and returns a string telling when the next leap year will be.



# 3. Write a method that takes in two years as arguments (a start_year and a last_year), and then prints out every single year between them that is a leap year.
